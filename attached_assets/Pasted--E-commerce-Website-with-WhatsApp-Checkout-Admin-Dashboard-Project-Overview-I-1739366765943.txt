**E-commerce Website with WhatsApp Checkout & Admin Dashboard**  

---

### **Project Overview**  
I need a simple **e-commerce website** where customers can:  
- Browse **products** and **categories**.  
- **Add multiple products to a cart**.  
- Place orders via **WhatsApp** instead of using a payment system.  

I also need an **Admin Dashboard** where I can:  
- **Add, edit, and delete** products.  
- Upload **product images**.  
- Organize products into **categories & tags** (e.g., New, Low Stock, Trending).  
- Track **orders in real-time** when a WhatsApp order is placed.  
- **Auto-update stock** when an item is sold.
